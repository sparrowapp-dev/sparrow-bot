# Instructions for Pushing to a Different Repository

Follow these steps to push the Sparrow Bot to a different repository:

## 1. Create a New Repository

First, create a new repository on GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name the repository "sparrow-bot"
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Initialize the Local Repository

In your terminal, navigate to the sparrow-bot directory and initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
cd sparrow-bot
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## 3. Add the Remote Repository

Add the new repository as a remote:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sparrow-bot.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## 4. Push to the Remote Repository

Push the code to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is named differently (e.g., "master"), use that name instead of "main".

## 5. Verify the Push

Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that the code has been pushed successfully.

## 6. Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

If you want to set up GitHub Actions for the repository:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. GitHub should automatically detect the workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory
3. Enable the workflows if prompted

## 7. Set Up GitHub Secrets (Optional)

If you plan to use the bot with GitHub Actions, you may need to set up secrets:

1. Go to the "Settings" tab in your repository
2. Click on "Secrets and variables" in the left sidebar
3. Click on "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add any required secrets (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`)

## 8. Update Documentation (Optional)

Update the documentation to reflect your repository:

1. Edit the README.md file to update any references to the repository URL
2. Update any other documentation files as needed

## 9. Release the Bot (Optional)

If you want to create a release:

1. Go to the "Releases" tab in your repository
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Enter a tag version (e.g., "v0.1.0")
4. Enter a release title
5. Add release notes
6. Click "Publish release"
